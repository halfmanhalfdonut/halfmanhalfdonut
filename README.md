### Why `halfmanhalfdonut`?
The nickname came from playing [NHL94](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_'94) with [my buddy](https://nhl94hockey.com/user/HeatRash) online. We occasionally play the game where we start on opposite ends of the alphabet and work through the [teams](https://nhl94hockey.com/teams/), one team at a time, until you lose a game. For example, let's say I start with the [Anaheim Mighty Ducks](https://nhl94hockey.com/team/anaheim-mighty-ducks/) and he starts with the [Winnipeg Jets](https://nhl94hockey.com/team/winnipeg-jets/). He wins game one. So in game two, I would be the [Boston Bruins](https://nhl94hockey.com/team/boston-bruins/) while he would remain the Winnipeg Jets. If I won that game, I would remain the Boston Bruins and he would become the [Washington Capitals](https://nhl94hockey.com/team/washington-capitals/). Thus it goes until we get bored and move to something else.

Eventually I got stuck on the [Montreal Canadiens](https://nhl94hockey.com/team/montreal-canadiens/). I kept winning despite not being a big fan of them. In the game, they have a center named [Kirk Muller](https://www.nhl.com/player/kirk-muller-8449740) whose name shows up as K Muller, which we then started pronouncing as one word: "Kmuller" - and after a bunch of goals by Kmuller, he became "Kmuller the [Cruller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruller)," which then became a stupid chant/slogan of "Kmuller the Cruller, half man, half donut."

So there you go. It's all Kirk Muller and NHL94's fault.
